                    country's flag. The colour black represents the people of the Republic of Kenya, red for the blood shed
                    during the fight for independence, and green for the country's landscape and natural wealth. The white
                    fimbriation was added later to symbolise peace and honesty. The black, red, and white traditional Maasai
                    shield and two spears symbolise the defense of all the things mentioned above.</p>

                <h2 class="text-center heading">About Kenya</h2>
                <p class="content">Kenya, officially the Republic of Kenya, is a country in Africa and a founding member of the East African
                    Community (EAC). Its capital and largest city is Nairobi. Kenya's territory lies on the equator and overlies
                    the East African Rift covering a diverse and expansive terrain that extends roughly from Lake Victoria
                    to Lake Turkana (formerly called Lake Rudolf) and further south-east to the Indian Ocean. It is bordered
                    by Tanzania to the south and southwest, Uganda to the west, South Sudan to the north-west, Ethiopia to
                    the north and Somalia to the north-east. Kenya covers 581,309 km2 (224,445 sq mi), and had a population
                    of approximately 48 million people in January 2017.
                </p>
                <p class="content">Kenya has a warm and humid tropical climate on its Indian Ocean coastline. The climate is cooler in the savannah
                    grasslands around the capital city, Nairobi, and especially closer to Mount Kenya, which has snow permanently
                    on its peaks. Further inland are highlands in Central and Rift Valley regions where tea and coffee are
                    grown as cash crops which are major foreign revenue earners. In the West are Nyanza and Western regions,
                    there is an equatorial, hot and dry climate which becomes humid around Lake Victoria, the largest tropical
                    fresh-water lake in the world. This gives way to temperate and forested hilly areas in the neighbouring
                    western region. The north-eastern regions along the border with Somalia and Ethiopia are arid and semi-arid
                    areas with near-desert landscapes. Kenya is known for its world class athletes in track and field and
                    rugby. Thanks to its diverse climate and geography, expansive wildlife reserves and national parks such
                    as the East and West Tsavo National Park, Amboseli National Park, Maasai Mara, Lake Nakuru National Park,
                    Aberdares National Park and white sand beaches at the Coastal region, Kenya is home to the modern safari
                    and has several world heritage sites such as Lamu and numerous beaches, including in Diani, Bamburi and
                    Kilifi, where international yachting competitions are held every year.

                    The African Great Lakes region, which Kenya is a part of, has been inhabited by humans since the Lower Paleolithic period.
                    By the first millennium AD, the Bantu expansion had reached the area from West-Central Africa. The borders
                    of the modern state consequently comprise the crossroads of the Niger-Congo, Nilo-Saharan and Afroasiatic
                    areas of the continent, representing most major ethnolinguistic groups found in Africa. Bantu and Nilotic
                    populations together constitute around 97% of the nation's residents. European and Arab presence in coastal
                    Mombasa dates to the Early Modern period; European exploration of the interior began in the 19th century.
                    The British Empire established the East Africa Protectorate in 1895, which starting in 1920 gave way
                    to the Kenya Colony. Kenya obtained independence in December 1963. Following a referendum in August 2010
                    and adoption of a new constitution, Kenya is now divided into 47 semi-autonomous counties, governed by
                    elected governors.

                <p class="content">
                    The capital, Nairobi, is a regional commercial hub. The economy of Kenya is the largest by GDP in East and Central Africa.
                    Agriculture is a major employer; the country traditionally exports tea and coffee and has more recently
                    begun to export fresh flowers to Europe. The service industry is also a major economic driver. Additionally,
                    Kenya is a member of the East African Community trade bloc.
